The following section provides example R code for modelling the spatial distribution and density of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem (VME) indicator taxa in New Zealand waters using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The density of 14 VME indicator taxa was predicted under both present and future climate change scenarios. The results of this work are presented in the manuscript “Identifying climate refugia for vulnerable marine ecosystem indicator taxa under future climate change scenarios,” available online: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479724026215
